We have conducted our experiments using two real datasets, i.e. DBpedia and YAGO2. We used a set of queries from 10 different metropolitan areas. More precisely, we used 100 queries in total, i.e. 10 queries per area. We provide one file per dataset (i.e., queryset\_dbpedia and queryset\_yago2). These files  include for each query: i) the query location ("x","y"), ii) an incremental query ID ("id") and iii) the respective S set (i.e. for the maximum K=1000). The S consists of objects with i) the URI of a place, ii) location, and iii) a numerical ID.
