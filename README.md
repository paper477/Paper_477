We have conducted our experiments using two real datasets, i.e. DBpedia and YAGO2. We used a set of queries from 10 different metropolitan areas. More precisely, we used 100 queries in total, i.e. 10 queries per area. We provide one file per dataset. The file (queryset\_dbpedia and queryset\_yago2) includes, for each query, 1) the query location $x$,$y$, 2) an incremental query ID $id$ and 3) the respective $\mathcal{S}$ set (i.e. for the maximum $K=1000$). The $\mathcal{S}$ consists of objects with 1) the URI of a place, 2) location, and 3) a numerical ID.
